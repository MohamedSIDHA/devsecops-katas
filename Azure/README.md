* **Lab 1: Create a virtual machine in the portal :**

Create a Virtual Machine in the Azure Portal

To create a virtual machine in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in.

2. In the search bar, type "virtual machines" and select **Virtual machines**.

3. On the Virtual machines page, select **Create**.

4. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following information:
   - **Virtual machine name**: Enter a name for your virtual machine.
   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription that you want to use to create the virtual machine.
   - **Resource group**: Select a resource group to place the virtual machine in, or create a new one.
   - **Region**: Select the region where you want to create the virtual machine.
   - **Image**: Select the operating system image that you want to use for your virtual machine.
   - **Size**: Select the size of the virtual machine.

5. On the **Admin username** tab, enter the username and password that you want to use to log in to the virtual machine.

6. On the **Networking** tab, select the virtual network and subnet that you want to use for the virtual machine. You can also create a new virtual network and subnet if you don't have one.

7. On the **Management** tab, select the virtual machine size and availability options that you want.

8. On the **Storage** tab, select the type and size of storage that you want to use for the virtual machine.

9. On the **Advanced** tab, configure any additional settings that you want.

10. Once you have configured all of the settings, select **Review + create**.

11. Review the settings and select **Create**.

12. The Azure portal will start creating the virtual machine. Once the virtual machine is created, you can connect to it and start using it.

Here are some additional tips for creating a virtual machine in the Azure portal:

- If you are creating a virtual machine for the first time, you may want to use a pre-defined image, such as the Windows Server 2022 Datacenter image.

- If you are creating a virtual machine for a specific purpose, such as running a web application, you may want to select a specialized image, such as the Web Server image.

- You can also create your own custom image if you have specific requirements.

- When choosing the size of the virtual machine, consider the amount of resources that you need for the applications that you will be running on it.

- You can also configure autoscaling for your virtual machine so that it can automatically scale up or down based on demand.

- Once you have created the virtual machine, you can connect to it using Remote Desktop.
